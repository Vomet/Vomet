Coding enthusiast from Florida. I only know Python, but I may consider learning new programming languages in the future.

This account contains some repos for projects I have worked on. I don't maintain them that often.
- View my Replit profile [here](https://replit.com/@Vomet).

## Future Plans
- [ ] Learn Raspberry Pi stuff (if I can get my hands on it)
- [x] Book summary repo/blog (not quite sure on specifics yet)
  - [ ] Get it working on GitHub pages.
